=========================

**data enhancement:**extrapolate  
**Texas sharp shooter fallacy**(神射手谬误)

股市模拟:

*   efficient market hypothesis:有效性市场假说==>随机漫步模型
    *   stock & market
    *   adjusted for risk
    *   distribution
    *   multiplicative vs additive
    *   memoryless(Poisson):无记忆性

**think computationly**

**computational thinking:**

*   identify or invent useful abstractions
*   formulate solution to a problem as a computational experiment
*   design and construct a sufficiently implementation of experiment
*   validate experimental setup
*   run experment
*   evaluate results of experiment
*   repeat as needed

Abstraction:

*   choosing the right abstractions
*   operating in terms of multiple layers of abstractions simultaneously
*   defining the relationships the between

Automation:

*   think in terms of machineizing our abstractions
*   Mechanization is possible

thinking recursively:

*   Reformulating a seemingly difficult problem into one which we know how to solve
*   Reduction,cmbedding,transformation,simulation

Take it a step at time:

*   understand problem
*   think about overall structure and algorithm independently of expression in programming language
*   break into small parts
*   identify useful abstractions
*   code and unit test a part at a time
*   first functionality, then efficiency
*   start with pseudo code

By systematic:

*   when debugging, think scientific method
*   ask yourself why program did what it did, not why it didn’t do what you wanted it to do.
